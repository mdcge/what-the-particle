# What The Particle

This project is comprised of two main components:

1. Mount Charles, a custom GEANT4-style particle propagator.
2. What The Particle, an interactive guessing game which uses Mount Charles.

This project was originally created as an outreach tool for the LiquidO experiment, and was partly inspired by the Zooniverse's [Name That Neutrino][https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/icecubeobservatory/name-that-neutrino] project.

Mount Charles is written in pure Rust, while the game renders the results of the simulation using JavaScript (specifically ThreeJS).
